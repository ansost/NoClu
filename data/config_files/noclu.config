# HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG FILE: 
# This file serves as input for the script 'code/noclu.py'. 
# 
# The following arguments need to be set in this file: 
# <input>: path to input data, must be ".npy" - str
# 
# <combinations>: List of clustering algorithms and number of clusters/epsilon. 
#    Valid algos are 'kmeans', 'dbscan', 'ward'. 
#    For example: ['kmeans_2', 'dbscan_0.5', 'ward_2'] runs kmeans with 2
#    clusters, HDBSCAN with epsilon 2 and ward's hierarchichal clustering with 2 clusters.
# 
# <saveto>: path to save output to - str
# 
# <gold_labels>: path to true labels of the input - str
