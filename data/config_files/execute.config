# HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG FILE:
# This file serves as input for the script 'code/noclu.py'.
#
# The following arguments need to be set in this file:
# - input: filepath to preprocessed, low dimension word embeddings, must be '.npy' file
# - gold_labels: filepath to gold labels, must be '.npy' file
# - combinations: list of combinations of clustering algorithms and number of clusters, must be list of str
# - saveto: path to save clustering output to, must be str

input: "../data/dim_reduced_input/nonsynchr_pcatsne_277_2.npy"

saveTo: "../data/clustering_output/"
