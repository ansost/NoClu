# HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG FILE:
# This file serves as input for the script "code/pca_tsne.py".
# The following arguments need to be set in this file:
#
# - Conditions: Specify whether you want just PCA or PCA followed by t-SNE,
# and how many dimensions/components to reduce to.
# Each inidividual combination is delimited by underscores,
# all combinations are stored in the list called 'combinations' below.
#
# For example:
# "pca_300" = PCA with 300 components
# "pcatsne_300_2" = PCA with 300 components followed by t-SNE with 2 dimensions.
#
# input: filepath to preprocessed vectors, must be '.npy' file

input: "../data/vectors_metadata/nonsynchr_casevectors.npy"

conditions: [
    "pcatsne_20_2",
    "pcatsne_30_2",
    "pcatsne_50_2",
    "pcatsne_100_2",
]
