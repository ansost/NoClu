# HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG FILE: 
# This file serves as input for the script "code/pca_tsne.py". 
# Specify whether you want just PCA or PCA followed by t-SNE, 
# and how many dimensions/components to reduce to. 
# Each inidividual combination is delimited by underscores, 
# all combinations are stored in the list called 'combinations' below. 
#
# For example: 
# "pca_300" = PCA with 300 components
# "pcatsne_300_2" = PCA with 300 components followed by t-SNE with 2 dimensions.
