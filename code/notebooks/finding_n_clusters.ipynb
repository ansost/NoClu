    "# Find optimal number of clusters/eplison for k means and DBSCAN\n",
    "For both algorithms, the elbow method is used. For `k-means` the optimal number of clusters is the value after which the distortion/inertia start decreasing in a linear way. For `DBSCAN`, the optimal value of epsilon is the distance value at which the rate of change is the highest. The optimal value of epsilon/n clusters is the value at the elbow of the curve, however where this elbow is can be difficult to determine. \n",
